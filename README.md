# RachelHateWebsite# Rachel Hate Website 😤🔥

Welcome to my very first web development project — a humorous and cathartic HTML/CSS website dedicated to expressing some strong opinions about a certain character from the webtoon *Tower of God*... yes, it's Rachel 😬.

> 🚨 Warning: This site is not for Rachel sympathizers.

- Semantic HTML structure
- External CSS styling
- Navigation bar with internal section linking
- Hover effects and link customization
- Embedded images and lists
- GitHub Pages deployment
