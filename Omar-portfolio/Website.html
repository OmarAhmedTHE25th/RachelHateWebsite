       <h2 id="AboutSection">About Rachel:</h2>
       <p>Rachel is a major character from the manhwa Tower of God by SIU. She begins as the quiet, mysterious girl who serves as the main motivation for the protagonist, Bam, to enter the Tower. To him, she is everything — light, purpose, and the reason he continues to move forward.

But Rachel has secrets. Dangerous ones.

Unlike Bam, who climbs for friendship and answers, Rachel climbs for herself. She wants to see the stars — not metaphorically, but literally. And for that dream, she’s willing to betray, lie, manipulate, and even hurt the very people who love her.

Some fans argue that she’s just a victim of the Tower’s cruelty. Others believe she’s the most cold-blooded and selfish character in the entire series.

What’s certain is this:
Rachel isn’t your typical villain. She doesn’t cackle or monologue. She whispers. She acts like a friend. And when you’re not looking…

She stabs you in the back.

           <p id="FP">"Oh my God just thinking about Rachel make me want to pull my hair out she's so irritating. She played the victim card. Saying that bam stole things from her (I guess it's the destiny to revenge jahad) like she ever had it in the first place??????? She's so entitled, she can't even fight, I don't understand why she can come that far she doesn't have any quality except run her mouth, manipulating people, stole weapon or stuff and clinging the those who more powerful than her.

           <h2 id="SIU comment"> Author's comment on Rachel (SIU)</h2>
<p>SIU himself sees Rachel, not as a villain, but the opposite of Baam. She is a character he cares about a lot too, despite her getting hate. He has lots to say about Rachel, though he intends to say it bit by bit as the time goes.</p>
